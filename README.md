# üåè VietNamTravel Website

## **Description**
This project is a continuation and improvement of the current [vietnamtravel.sbs](https://vietnamtravel.sbs) website, which currently lacks sufficient information, has a disorganized layout, and slower loading times.  

The website is all about **Vietnam destinations**, popular **food**, and **popular events** throughout the year.  

There is a **Contribution tab** where visitors can upload information to help expand the website‚Äôs content.  
**No user account is necessary** ‚Äî just jump in, explore, discover hidden gems, and share your experiences!  
*(Remember: don‚Äôt post anything too personal üòÑ)*
